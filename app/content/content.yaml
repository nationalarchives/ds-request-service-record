          military service record for someone who served in the British Armed Forces

      heading: Ways to request a record
      paragraph: There are two ways to request a record.
      options:
        - title: Standard
          paragraphs:
            - For most applicants a Standard request will provide the information they are looking for.
            - |
              Standard provides a subset of documents from the record. This may include details
              provided when they enlisted, records of service and testimonials.
            - Standard is not available for Commissioned Officer record requests.
        - title: Full record check
          paragraphs:
            - |
              Documents not provided in Standard will, in most cases, contain sensitive information and will be closed 
              to the public. However, we can complete a sensitivity check of the record to assess what can be released. 
              In some cases, we will not be able 
              to supply the record, or large parts of it will be redacted.

        need an Ancestry subscription or can use their pay-per-view service. Alternatively, you can access Ancestry
