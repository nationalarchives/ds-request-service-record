              Documents not provided in our standard subset will, in most cases, contain sensitive 
              information and will be closed by default. However, we can complete a sensitivity 
              check of the record to assess what can be released. In some cases, we will not be able 
              to supply the record at all, or large parts of it will be redacted.

        Due to the high volume of Home Guard records, with over 4 million transferred 
        to The National Archives, and the storage method used for these records, it 
        is unlikely that we will be able to locate the record of interest within a 
        reasonable timeframe.

        Records relating to the Durham Home Guard are currently available in our catalogue.

        The remaining Home Guard records will be made available via our partner, 
        Ancestry. We expect all Home Guard records that have been transferred will 
        be available via Ancestry by September 2027.

        Please only proceed if you are unable to wait until September 2027 by requesting 
        a paid search. You will then receive a quotation based on the estimated amount
