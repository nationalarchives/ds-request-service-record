            If the person whose record you are looking for was born after 1909, we require a digital 
            copy of proof of death for that individual. This is to protect any personal data that 
            might be in the record that relates to a living person.

        Service records are often categorised as either 'Commissioned Officers' or 
        'Other Ranks'. Information on whether the service person was a Commissioned 
        Officer will help confirm if the service record has been transferred to The 
        National Archives or is still with the Ministry of Defence.
  we_are_unlikely_to_find_this_record:
    heading: We are unlikely to be able to locate this record
    paragraphs:
      - |
        Due to the high volume of Home Guard records, 
        with over 4 million transferred to The National Archives, 
        and the storage method used for these records, 
        it is unlikely that we will be able to locate the record 
        of interest within a reasonable timeframe.
      - |
        Records relating to the Durham Home Guard are currently 
        available in our catalogue.
      - |
        The remaining Home Guard records will be made available via 
        our partner, Ancestry. We expect all Home Guard records that 
        have been transferred will be available via Ancestry by September 2027.

        Please only proceed if you are unable to wait until September 2027 by 
        requesting a paid search. You will then receive a quotation based on 
        the estimated amount of time it will take to locate the record.
